ESPuppy – User Guide

====================================================
General Usage Instructions
====================================================

ESPuppy is an interactive robotic system based on ESP32.
The robot reacts to touch interactions on the head and tail
and transitions between emotional states that affect:

- Motor movement
- Tail and ear servo behavior
- Eye animations on OLED displays
- Audio playback
- Cloud logging via Adafruit IO (optional)

Basic operation steps:
1. Power the ESP32 and external components (servos, motors).
2. Ensure WiFi connectivity is available.
3. (Optional) Enable session logging from Adafruit IO dashboard.
4. Interact with the robot using head and tail touch sensors.
5. Observe emotional responses (movement, sound, animation).

- Triggered by head petting duration.
- Robot moves forward or turns.
- Tail performs smooth side-to-side motion.
- Positive sound and eye animation.

ANNOYED:
- Triggered by tail touch or negative interaction.
- Robot moves backward slightly.

ANGRY:
- Triggered by repeated negative interaction.
- Robot moves backward aggressively.
- Ears move up, tail moves downward.

CONFUSED:
- Triggered by specific timing of interactions.
- Robot displays question mark animation.

SLEEPY:
- Triggered by inactivity.
- Eyes close and "Zzz" animation appears.
- Tail moves upward.
