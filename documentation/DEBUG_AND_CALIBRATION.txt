ESPuppy – Debug Messages & Calibration

====================================================
Debug Output
====================================================

The system prints debug and status messages to the Serial Monitor
(baud rate: 115200).

Common messages include:

"[SESSION] START / STOP"
- Indicates Adafruit IO session state change.

"[STATE] Changing from X -> Y"
- Emotional state transition.

"[SD] SD init FAILED!"
- SD card not detected or initialization failed.

"[AUDIO] File NOT FOUND on SD"
- MP3 file missing from SD card.

"[EAR] ledcAttachChannel FAILED"
"[TAIL] ledcAttachChannel FAILED"
- PWM channel attachment failed.

"[OLED] Left/Right display init FAILED!"
- OLED display initialization failure.

If no messages appear:
- Check baud rate (115200)
- Verify USB cable and board selection

Calibration Instructions
====================================================

Touch Sensors Calibration:
- Parameters:
  HEAD_THRESHOLD
  TAIL_THRESHOLD
- Calibration steps:
  1. Open Serial Monitor.
  2. Observe raw values when untouched.
  3. Touch sensor and observe new values.
  4. Set threshold slightly above touched value.
  5. Recompile and upload code.

Servo Calibration:
- Servo angle range: 30°–150°
- Use external 5V power supply to avoid jitter.

Motor Calibration:
- Motor speed and duration values are hard-coded.
- Adjust constants if movement is too fast or too slow.
